# Overview

This repository is for discussion and capture of requirements relating to 
a new astronomy data format. It contains both the requirements document
itself (in LaTex) which will contain a set of hierarchical requirements
and a related wiki and discussion issues where requirements are captured
proposed and discussed.

Requirements capture wiki: 

https://github.com/astrodataformat/requirements/wiki

Ideally requirements may trace back to Use Cases captured on the Use Case
wiki, but this is not enforced.
